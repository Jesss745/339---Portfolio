            <h1>Livestock - Lookbook Microstie</h1>
            <p> Created for an Interaction Design Methods class at SFU in the span of 3 months. Our initial goal was to find a company to collaborate with, understand their grievances, and create a design solution to solve a problem that we’ve discovered for the company. The project itself was a group project where my group, Dedgestock, worked together as a group of 4 and collaborated with LIVESTOCK. They’re a streetwear clothing store located in Vancouver with an online website under the domain deadstock.ca. My responsibility within this project was handling the art direction of our design. Whether it’s all of our posters, presentation slides, and final design of the design solution, which was a Digital Lookbook.</p>

    <!--==================== ART DIRECTION ====================-->

          <h2>Design Problem</h2>
          <img> 
            <p> Livestock’s website (deadstock.ca) follows a clear style guideline that is uniquely theirs and ensures that they’re recognizable even at a glance. The website is simplistic with minimal color. The use of GT America and GT America Mono results in clarity of text, consistency, and good legibility. All of these factors contribute to the website’s strong yet friendly character, evoking a sense of reliability and trustworthiness. </p>
            <p> However, Livestock is facing issues that deter customers from remaining loyal to Livestock. With inconsistent return policies and unsatisfactory customer service, customers do not want to re-purchase or recommend others to purchase from Livestock. On top of that, there is currently no incentive for customers to continuously shop at Livestock. Combine that with their already niche audience, its difficult for customers to gain new customers for their website. <p>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section id="research">
        <section class="element">
            <h2>Reserach</h2>
            <img>
            <p> Internal data of online shoppers’ purchasing behaviors from Livestock shows that when it comes to returns, 10.6% of customers return due to ordering the wrong sizes and 7.2% return because they change their mind. As such, our solution aims to minimize the possibility of these things happening. </p>

            <p> When visiting Livestock’s in-person store in Gastown, Vancouver to talk to customers and staff members. Through interviews with store staff, we found that they don’t have an issue with returns and exchanges. Store staff claim that creating a connection with customers through conversation and excellent customer service ensures that customers keep coming back to Livestock and will leave the store confident with their purchases.</p>

            <h3> Reframing the Problem </h3>
            <p> Framing After talking to the director of commerce of Livestock, they’ve also informed us that LIVESTOCK also really wants to push for more clothing item sales on their website. Combining all that with the research we have done, we decided that our design focus will be Designing an Interactive Lookbook that aligns with the interests and needs of the streetwear community. </p>
        </section>

    <section id="design-process">
        <section class="element">
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p> With all of our research in mind, we had 3 subgoals that we wanted to ensure we achieved with our design. </p>
            <img>
            <p> We then had to come up with the art direction for our design. I looked into LIVESTOCK’s branding to understand their design properly. This includes researching the fonts, brand colors, and LIVESTOCK’s general identity as a company. I browsed through  their social media platforms (instagram and X), official website and I confirmed all of this by also talking to LIVESTOCK’s Head of UI/UX, Cara Davies. From there, I created a branding guide on the shared Figma File, the platform where we create our designs, with my group members. </p>
            <img>
            <p> Within every stage of the process, we worked together and created all of our designs by presenting our ideas in the shared Figma file. I lead the design process our weekly deliverables of posters and our final solution as having one person help oversee the process ensures that we remain consistent in our design language and allows each person to shine in what they do best. We continued iterating on our ideas on figma with each person creating a version of the final website we wanted before coming together and choosing what we like best from each others. </p>

            <h2>Final Solution</h2>
            <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91LCIEOIMSw&feature=youtu.be"> Animated Walkthrough </a> </p>
            <img>
            <p> Our concept for Livestock is a seasonally recurring Interactive Lookbook that will live on the website. The Interactive Lookbook aims to align with the interests and needs of the streetwear community by featuring new collections of the season and offering information on the fit or story behind each product. Moreover, the Interactive Lookbook will marry the behaviors of an e-commerce website as users will have the ability to shop the featured products directly through the lookbook. </p>

            <p> We incorporated our existing design languages and made use of resources given to us by LIVESTOCK to create a Lookbook layout that can be used for various collections in the future. We decided to create a horizontal scrolling site to make it feel like reading through a book (left to right). This type of scroll is also unique and would help LIVESTOCK stand out from competitors. </p>

            <p> To minimize the amount of information that is present at a glance as when we did user testing, we discovered that visitors tend to simply look at the pictures to find one they find interesting before clicking it to find out more about the product. As such, the layout of the website is very simple but the picture still leads the eye through the pages. Since the end goal for LIVESTOCK as a company is always to sell products, our layout is meant to encourage customers from clicking on the product to learn more and potentially purchase them. </p>

            <h2>Project Takeaways</h2>
            <p> I went into the project interested in learning more about streetwear culture and refining my skills in finding a problem and coming up with a solution for it. In this case, the way we present clothes are very important for our target audience. As such, I want to ensure that my design continues to highlight pieces in a consistent way that’s familiar for the community while using inspiration from other fashion magazines and brands I enjoy to present information in a new, but interesting way. </p>

            <p> Moving forward, I would love to further refine all of our micro interactions to make it more interesting and create all of the pages we’re currently missing. Due to time constraints, we could not test our final solution in full detail either. Although we had gotten approval for the company, being able to test it with our target audience would allow us to do final refinements for our project,</p>
